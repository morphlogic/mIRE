# Immersive Real-Time Experience (mIRE)

Let yourself go, get sucked into a mIRE, and become someone else! Let your alter ego take over as you explore, create, engage, and socialize with other players, as well as with non-player characters (NPCs). mIRE's purpose is to provide the platform upon which one can create such a world, enabling its participants to do all of the above.

## Summary

A mIRE instance is intended to function similarly as a MUD (Multi-User Dimension)/MOO (MUD:  Object-Oriented), in that its users are able to achieve a (mostly) complete user experience armed with nothing more than a text-based telnet client.

While logged into the real-time system, users can, as in most MUDs/MOOs:

- Wander and navigate throughout a virtual realm, replete with individual rooms into and out of which users may traverse. Each room may contain a number of:
  - Other users,
  - Objects,
  - Non-player characters (aka "mobs" or "mobile NPCs"), and
  - Navigation points to reach other rooms.
- Create their own collections of rooms, known as areas, limited only by the user's own imagination:
  - Areas consist of some quantity of rooms.
  - Rooms can contain navigation points that:
    - ...lead to other rooms within the same area, or
    - ...serve as connections to specific rooms within other areas.
- Interact with characters, both human/player and artificial:
  - Team up to become a force to be reckoned with! This is the way to benefit from synergy; the whole is greater than the sum of its parts; group of players may accomplish feats too mighty for any individual member of the group. By teaming up, users can do, say, and impact more so than by flying solo,
  - Conduct business by bartering and entering into agreements with other characters,
  - Give gifts, both in material and immaterial form, and
  - Pursue quests that lead to riches and glory!
- Socialize! In a mIRE, users may:
  - Communicate with each other:
    - On public channels,
    - To others in the same room,
    - To all the members of a group, or
    - To another individual user.
  - Kick back in a safe area, e.g. a coffee shop, relax, and shoot the breeze without the threat of having one's virtual character physically harmed, and
  - In nearly any way you can imagine! The rules of mIREs that govern speech may vary from one to another, but the platform itself contains no in-built constraints with respect to socialization.

## What makes mIRE different than a MUD/MOO?

mIRE puts an emphasis on world-building - not just by immortals or implementors, though, but by players themselves!

[mechs - characters controlled primarily by mechanical constituents of the mIRE ]

[mycelial structure - world architecture allows the world to grow organically over time; dream/cells/hypha(connections); dreams can contain hundreds of cells or just a single one; exit:entrance ratio]
